## Description:
Taking the thought out of planning what's for dinner. An evening meal planning CRUD application where users can sign in, add their favorite meals to their collection, and get a randomized schedule of their meals. Once their schedule is generated they can shuffle their whole week or just swap individual days. Users' login dates are saved and read to ensure a new random selection of meals is generated each week. Users can also use the 'Shopping List' button to get a quick glimpse of their week's meals complete with their full list of ingredients.
* Use login username: _demo_, password: _demo_ to try it out!
